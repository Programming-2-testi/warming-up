     * - If the list is empty, an empty string is returned.
     * - If the list contains only one person, their name is returned ("Rachel").
     * - If the list contains two people, their names are joined with "and" in
     * between ("Rachel and Monica").
     * - If the list contains more than two people, the names of the first three
     * people are listed, followed by "and X others," where X is the number of
     * remaining people ("Rachel, Monica and 4 others").
     *

     * @return A formatted string representing the names of people in the list.
